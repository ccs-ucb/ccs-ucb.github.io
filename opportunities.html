        <h2>Prospective UC Berkeley Graduate Students</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">We are currently recruiting graduate students through the <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/graduate-program">UC Berkeley Psychology graduate program</a>. Please feel welcome to write to <a href="mailto:wdt@berkeley.edu">wdt@berkeley.edu</a> if you are planning to apply and wish to make contact beforehand. However, we cannot generally arrange meetings with or provide feedback to potential applicants before application submission, for reasons of equity and resources (most years we receive many more enquiries from prospective applicants than we are able to respond to individually, unfortunately).</p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">As a general rule, prospective students should have a strong interest in basic research in cognition and computation with a focus on social intelligence or language, and a strong technical background (including some combination of experience with: web development, data analysis, mathematical modelling, or machine learning). Generally speaking applicants will have an educational history that includes substantial prior engagement with cognitive science, but we are always excited to hear from people who would bring new expertise to our team. We welcome applicants of all identities and backgrounds, and actively encourage applications from students with a background that is under-represented in the computational sciences.</p>


        <h2>Prospective UC Berkeley Research Assistants</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">We recruit undergraduate research assistants through the UC Berkeley <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/">Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program</a> and the Department of Psychology's <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/research-discovery">Research and Discovery Program</a>. If you are interested in working as a research assisntant but are not eligible for these schemes, please feel free to get in contact with us directly (<a href="mailto:wdt@berkeley.edu">wdt@berkeley.edu</a>).</p>
        
        <h2>Prospective Postdoctoral Researchers</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">If you are interested in undertaking postdoctoral research in the lab, please contact us (<a href="mailto:wdt@berkeley.edu">wdt@berkeley.edu</a>) directly.</p>
        
        <h2>Prospective Visiting Students</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5;">If you are interested in visiting the lab please contact us (<a href="mailto:wdt@berkeley.edu">wdt@berkeley.edu</a>) directly. We don't generally have funds available to support visitors financially, but we love hosting visitors where possible. See <a href="https://vspa.berkeley.edu/initiate/overview/visiting-student-researchers">https://vspa.berkeley.edu/initiate/overview/visiting-student-researchers</a> for information about UC Berkeley's visiting student scheme and <a href="https://globalengagement.berkeley.edu/delegations-visitors/visiting-scholars-researchers-postdocs">https://globalengagement.berkeley.edu/delegations-visitors/visiting-scholars-researchers-postdocs</a> for the visiting scholar scheme.</p>
